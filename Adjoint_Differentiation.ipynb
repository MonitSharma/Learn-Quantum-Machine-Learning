Parameter-shift gradients require at least two executions per parameter, so that method gets more and more expensive with the size of the circuit, especially on simulators.

Simulation of large circuits is already RAM-limited, and backpropagation constrains the size of possible circuits even more. PennyLane also achieves backpropagation derivatives from a Python simulator and interface-specific functions. The `\"lightning.qubit\"` device does not support backpropagation, so backpropagation derivatives lose the speedup from an optimized simulator.\n",
